Name - Terrell Johnson
Father - Tysen Johnson(30 when I was born, Walmart manager, single father) 
Mother - Joane Vanderbilt(Died at 30 from giving birth to me) 
 
The story starts when I was 14 and joined AAU team in basketball. My character is extremely humorous, handsome and extremely athletic. Most guys described my playstyle as an athletic and explosive Rajon Rondo. Very great at passing, very shifty, great handles, super athletic, fast and explosive, a defensive demon but lacks a lot in shooting


I am a basketball player at the end I am going to be a 6'3 point guard at the age of 19 which is going to be my max height. 

I am born in East Chicago Indiana USA in a hood full of gangsters. My father is a gangster but is leaning less on that side of life because of his love to me. I joined the gang but focused more in basketball. While in the gang I remember my uncle getting killed by a rival gang and my friend which is just 16 by that time getting shot in front of my eyes. I got into multiple fights both with my schoolmates and my rivals. Got into a gunfight twice before I said enough and focused on basketball at 14. I enrolled at a [insert high school name in East Chicago Indiana] and got recruited on their basketball team

I did have a sister but she went missing when she's 10 and I am 7. My father is hardworking and is doing everything he can do fund me and my basketball dream. He's the best

Your story is intense—Terrell’s background makes his rise in basketball even more powerful. His past, from witnessing gang violence to refocusing on hoops, adds depth to his character. With his father’s sacrifices and his own resilience, his journey to the NBA will be one to remember.

What high school did he attend in East Chicago? Also, did he start as a varsity player right away, or did he have to prove himself first?

🏀 Terrell Johnson: The Rise of a Legend
Game Scenario - Age 14

📍 Location: East Chicago, Indiana
👤 You are Terrell Johnson, a 14-year-old with insane athleticism, flashy passing, and elite defense—but with a weak jump shot. You’ve lived a tough life, growing up in a dangerous neighborhood, losing your mother at birth, and seeing your uncle and friend murdered. You were briefly part of a gang but decided to go all-in on basketball.

Your father, Tysen, works hard at Walmart to support your dreams. You just enrolled at [Insert High School Name], where you’re trying out for the basketball team.

🔷 Your Goals:
Earn a spot on the varsity team
Gain recognition from scouts and AAU coaches
Improve your weaknesses (shooting, turnovers, leadership, etc.)
Navigate challenges from your past (gang violence, school conflicts, etc.)
🔷 Choices (Pick 2 to Start):
1️⃣ Basketball Tryouts: Show off your skills, but will the coach see you as a playmaker or a risk?
2️⃣ AAU Summer Circuit: Get noticed by big-name scouts, but competition is fierce.
3️⃣ Streetball Reputation: Earn respect through local games, but risk injury or distractions.
4️⃣ Focus on Academics: A 2.0 GPA won’t cut it for college ball—do you hit the books or gamble on talent?
5️⃣ Confronting the Past: Old gang ties and enemies still exist. Do you stay out of trouble or handle unfinished business?

What’s your move? 🏀🔥
